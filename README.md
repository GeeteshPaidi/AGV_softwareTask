## Path Finding Algorithms
A* and CBS are one of the best path finding algorithms although both are used for different reasons.   
A* is the best for single agent path finding whereas CBS is best for Multi Agent Path finding.   
Feel free to use the code for learning purposes.   
You are appreciated to improve the code and send pull requests so the code can be improvised.
